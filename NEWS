                  Changes in hwde version 0.63

CHANGES

    o The vignette hwde.Rnw has been modified to add missing text and to
      conform to current Sweave markup conventions
    o Code for the functions hwde() and make.contrasts() has been modified
      so that R CMD check no longer reports "No visible binding for global
      variable 'oset'."
