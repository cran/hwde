        and Independence Between Loci
Author: John Maindonald, with \code{hwexact()} from Randall Johnson.

Description: Fits models for genotypic disequilibria, as described in
  Huttley and Wilson (2000), Weir (1996) and Weir and Wilson (1986).
  Contrast terms are available that account for first order interactions
  between loci.  Also implements, for a single locus in a single
  population, a conditional exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
